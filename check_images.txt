4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The model architecture that I feel did the best at classifyoing the four uploaded images was the resnet architecture. This is because it was the only model that correctly classified images that were not dogs and images that were dogs. Even though the architecture didn't correctly classify two of the images, it still did a good job in identifying that Beagle_02.jpg is a dog (even though it classified it as an ibizan hound) and Mug_02.jpg is a cup(which is close to a mug).

The two other architecture, however, didn't correctly classify the images that were not dogs and images that were dogs (getting only 50% right). Also, the worst at classifying the images was alexnet architecture, which classified Beagle_02.jpg as radiator and Mug_01.jpg as meat cleaver
