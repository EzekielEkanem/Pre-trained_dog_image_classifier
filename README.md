# Udacity AI Programming with Python First Project
# Project: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

Submitted by: Ezekiel Ekanem

This program uses python to classify dog breeds with the aid of a pre-trained image classifier. 

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Receives 3 Command Line Arugments from user as input from the user running the program from a terminal window**
- [x] **Creates the pet labels from the image's filename**
- [x] **Uses the classifier function that has been pre-trained to create the classifier labels and then compares the classifier labels to the pet image labels**
- [x] **Adjusts the results dictionary to indicate whether or not the pet image label is of-a-dog, and to indicate whether or not the classifier image label is of-a-dog**
- [x] **Calculates the statistics of the results of the program run using the classifier's model architecture to classify the images**
- [x] **Prints the results statistics from the results statistics dictionary (results_stats_dic)**
